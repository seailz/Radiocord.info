# PLAESE NOTE: Our premium service is not currently implemented.

## What is a premium token?
When you purchase a premium subscription to our bot, we will provide you with a set amount of "Premium Tokens" (determined by the plan you select) to your account. These premium tokens are able to be activated (on servers that you have the "ADMINISTRATOR" permission on) to allow for access to premium features. Once a premium token has been activated, the count will be lowered in our database.
A premium token will be deactivated and added back to your account if told by the user, if the server gets deleted, or the bot gets kicked from the server.
